Welcome to my Github! I am a second-year astronomy graduate student.

Here are some things about me:

- ✏️ I am a student at the University of Wyoming 🤠
- 🔭 I am currently researching mass loss rates for massive stars using infrared bowshock data 🌟
- ✉️ My email: npatten@uwyo.edu
- 🌐 I am learning the Irish language, Gaeilge 🇮🇪 and I am always looking for an opportunity to improve my skills!

**Is fearr Gaeilge bhriste ná Béarla cliste! ☘️**

Feel free to reach out to me about anything!
